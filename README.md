### Project Title: Bikeshare Project


### Description: Working with Bikeshare data
In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Python code were written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. A script that takes in raw input was written to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used: Bikeshare.py, washinton.csv, new-york-city.csv, chicago.csv
